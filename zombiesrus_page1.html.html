<p>Welcome to Zombies 'R Us. We are your one stop shop in beginning your Zombie Acopalypse Preparedness Plan (ZAPP).  While there are still many disbelievers out there, let's take a few moments to check out the facts.</p>
<br />
<p>Last year, the CDC released a <a href="http://blogs.cdc.gov/publichealthmatters/2011/05/preparedness-101-zombie-apocalypse/">Preparedness 101:Zombie Apocalypse</a>. This was the CDC's guide in helping the citizens create an emergency plan. Think this was one big joke?</p>
<br />
<p>Just two years before, a <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2009-07-27-baby-killed_N.htm/">San Antonian</a> woman killed and ate the brains of her three week old baby. If that wasn't bad enough, she decided to eat a few of his toes as well.</p>
<br />
<p>In May of this year, two seperate Zombie attacks took place. The first included the <a href="http://news.blog.cnn.com/2012/05/30/security-video-shows-entire-miami-attack/">face</a> of the victim being completely eaten. The second was a <a href="http://www.drugs-forum.com/forum/showthread.php?t=186769/">homeless man</a> trying to literally eat a police officer's hand.</p>
<br />
<p>Jump forward to June 2012. Eight countes in Maine came together to do a <a href="http://www.ems1.com/ems-training/articles/1305390-maine-town-prepares-for-zombie-response/">Zombie Apocalypse Medical Response</a> training day. Different stages of the infection were even categorized for the Medical Response teams to know how to deal with each situation.</p>
<br />
<p>And just when we thought this Zombie craze was finished, last week a <a href="http://philadelphia.cbslocal.com/2012/09/13/cops-naked-man-gnawed-on-womans-head-during-wild-neighborhood-rampage/">Pennsylvania man</a> jumped out a second-story window and attacked a woman, gnawing at her head. Luckily, the woman had been walking with another female friend, and both women were able to get away. The police were notified.</p>
<br />
<p>Whether you like it or not, are you prepared for the Zombie Apocalypse?</p>
